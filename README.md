## Login flooder

Sends a list of usernames (converted to emails) and passwords (random ones) to a login page

### Description

Reads the file names.txt (at the moment contains 2000 names, can be edited with custom names) and converts every line into:
```name```+```1 random digit```+```@yahoo.com```

Then it generates a random password (8-13 characters) and sends it to a login page.

All of this can be changed in the code.

⚠️ The script does not use any kind of proxy, have that in mind ⚠️

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/r4v10l1/login_flooder
cd login_flooder
python3 login_flooder.py  # Must change code to set your target
```
